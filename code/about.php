With the moodle quiz engine, it’s easier to utilize educationally sound assessment strategies which would be too difficult to implement with paper and pencil. Most people think of tests as an infrequent, high-stakes activity, like mid-terms and finals. Better strategies involve frequent, low-stakes assessments you and your students can use to guide their performance at any time during the course. Creating a series of small mini-tests gives you a very flexible system for gauging performance and keeping students engaged. Here are a few ideas for quick quizzes you can use as part of a larger assessment strategy.

Getting students to complete reading assignments has to be one of the hardest motivational tasks in education. Reading is critical to understanding most material, and fundamental to success in many classes. The problem for most students is there is no immediate reward or punishment for procrastinating on a reading assignment. Creating a little mini-test for each reading assignment solves a number of problems. First, it encourages students to do the reading so they can do well on the quiz. Second, it gives the students feedback on how well they understood the reading assignment. Third, it gives you data about what aspects of the reading students found confusing, and which they have already mastered so you can focus your course activities.

For a reading mini-test, I would recommend setting a limited time quiz students can only take once. Because it’s a low-stakes activity you want students to use for self-assessment, set-up the quiz to display feedback and correct answers. If you’re concerned about students sharing answers after they've taken the quiz, randomize the question and answer order. If you have a Question bank, make some of the questions random as well. As an additional assignment, students should write down one question about a question they got wrong, and bring it to class or post it to a forum for discussion. </p>
        <h4>Test practice </h4>
        <p>
The key to effective practice is to have a realistic practice environment. Many students worry about tests, especially high-stakes tests, because they have no idea what to expect.

        </p><p>What question format will you use? </p>
        <p>How detailed will the questions be? </p>
        <p>What should they study?</p>

        <p>You can help alleviate test anxiety by creating a practice test students can take to help answer these questions. These tests are usually based on old questions similar to the current test questions. Use last year's final as an example test, which will force you into the practice of writing new questions every year. This is a good idea anyway, as you can be sure someone has a copy of last year’s test they are sharing with others.</p>


To set up a practice test, create a zero point test with questions from the year before in random order with random answers. Allow students to take the test as many times as they’d like so they can test themselves as much as they need. Display feedback, but not correct answers so it presents more of a challenge.
